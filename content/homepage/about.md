I am on the job market next year (Spring 2023)! Reach out at either of the addresses above.
## About
I am a third year Ph.D student in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA. I am working under the supervision of Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

I was a graduate of École Polytechnique in Paris, where I double majored in math and CS. I joined the Master in Language Technologies at CMU in 2017.


## Research interests

### AI security

The Deep Learning models that have revolutionized the fields of Computer Vision, Speech and Language Processing, can behave strangely out of their training domain. Agents with malicious intents can actively create these contexts in order to exploit deployed Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems : force self-driving cars to confuse signs and crash, military drones to mistake hospitals for military bases, personal assistants or smartphones to reveal private user information, etc.

In my thesis I work on formalizing, evaluating and mitigating these threats, such as adversarial perturbations, data poisoning, privacy attacks, etc. My long-term research goal is to contribute to the safe development of Artificial Intelligence, so that society can benefit and not suffer from it.

I also believe that security is a fascinating and central aspect of AI from a theoretical perspective. People who create these models want to replicate aspects of human intelligence, and security threats arise precisely when models behave differently from humans (in a way that attackers can control). I would argue that making models safer is equivalent to making them better.


### Speech Recognition

Some aspects of AI security are common to all models, but other are specific to certain applications and architectures. When investigating the latter I focus on Speech processing applications, and in particular Automatic Speech Recognition. I am a member of the Machine Learning and Signal Processing research group at CMU. I have also conducted two internships in the Alexa Hybrid Science team in Pittsburgh, where I investigated attacks against and defenses for Amazon Alexa’s speech-to-text models.

## Other interests
In my free time I read classic novels, watch films, brew coffee, play tennis and bridge (I’m looking for bridge partners in the Pittsburgh area).

I like photography too. Go check http://www.raphaelolivier.com. Sadly it belongs to a very talented homonym but I get to lure people I meet into thinking it's mine.
